Kursat KARA is an Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Oklahoma State University. He received his BSc and MSc degrees from Istanbul Technical University and a Ph.D. degree from Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA. His doctoral dissertation was on hypersonic boundary layer receptivity to acoustic disturbances over cones.

Dr. Kara’s research interests include computational aerodynamics / fluid dynamics, hypersonic boundary-layer transition, supersonic hot jet simulations for aeroacoustics, high order accurate schemes, active flow control, wind energy (with Dr. Sankar from Georgia Tech), and spray cooling of electronics. His research has been funded by the NASA Langley Research Center, the U.S. Navy Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Khalifa University.

Dr. Kara is a Senior Member of AIAA and Member of AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee.

•Technical Chair of 34th AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference (Aviation 2016), Washington DC.

•Technical Co-Chair of AIAA 32nd AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference (Aviation 2014) Atlanta, GA.
